# workflow
- run the application with "MSW_ENABLED=true NODE_ENV=development pnpm dev"
- use playwright mcp to test new features in the browser
- pnpm is using for installing packages and running the app
- use 'pnpm playwright test  --reporter=line' to test your work, and update test cases when functionality is added
Ok that the new feature works.
